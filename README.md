# Fetch Backend Internship Challenge

## Overview

This project is a solution to the Fetch Backend Internship Challenge. The project implements a REST API to track and spend points from multiple payers based on the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The API allows users to:
- Add transactions (points from payers).
- Spend points using the FIFO rule.
- Retrieve the current balance of points for each payer.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Gradle** for build automation
- **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code
- **Postman** or **curl** for API testing

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17** must be installed and set as the default JVM.
- **Gradle** is used for building the project (a Gradle wrapper is included, so no need to install Gradle globally).
- **Postman** or **curl** for testing the API endpoints.

## Setup Instructions
